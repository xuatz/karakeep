# Search Query Language

Karakeep provides a search query language to filter and find bookmarks. Here are all the supported qualifiers and how to use them:

## Basic Syntax

- Use spaces to separate multiple conditions (implicit AND)
- Use `and`/`or` keywords for explicit boolean logic
- Prefix qualifiers with `-` or `!` to negate them (e.g., `-is:archived` or `!is:archived`)
- Use parentheses `()` for grouping conditions (note that groups can't be negated)

## Qualifiers

Here's a comprehensive table of all supported qualifiers:

| Qualifier                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               | Example Usage                                |

### Examples

```plaintext
# Find favorited bookmarks from 2023 that are tagged "important"
is:fav after:2023-01-01 before:2023-12-31 #important

# Find archived bookmarks that are either in "reading" list or tagged "work"
is:archived and (list:reading or #work)

# Find bookmarks that are not tagged or not in any list
-is:tagged or -is:inlist

# Find bookmarks that have notes but no highlights
has:notes -has:highlights

# Find bookmarks with "React" in the title
title:React
```

## Combining Conditions

You can combine multiple conditions using boolean logic:

```plaintext
# Find favorited bookmarks from 2023 that are tagged "important"
is:fav after:2023-01-01 before:2023-12-31 #important

# Find archived bookmarks that are either in "reading" list or tagged "work"
is:archived and (list:reading or #work)

# Find bookmarks that are not favorited and not archived
-is:fav -is:archived

# Using ! as an alias for negation
!is:fav !is:archived

# Using tag: as an alias for #
tag:important tag:"work in progress"
```

## Text Search

Any text not part of a qualifier will be treated as a full-text search:

```plaintext
# Search for "machine learning" in bookmark content
machine learning

# Combine text search with qualifiers
machine learning is:fav
```
