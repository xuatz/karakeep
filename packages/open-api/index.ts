        "You can generate an API key from the Karakeep web UI under **Settings > API Keys**.\n\n" +

        "The response includes a `nextCursor` field — pass it as the `cursor` parameter to fetch the next page. " +
        "A `null` value for `nextCursor` indicates there are no more results.\n\n" +
        "## Bookmark Types\n\n" +
        "Bookmarks can be one of three types:\n" +
        "- **link** — A URL bookmark with optional crawled metadata.\n" +
        "- **text** — A plain text note.\n" +
        "- **asset** — An uploaded file (image or PDF).\n\n## Rate Limiting\n\nWhen rate limiting is enabled, the API enforces per-IP request limits. " +
